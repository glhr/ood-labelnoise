Run ``bash data/download_openood_datasets.sh`` (from the parent directory) to download CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN, MNIST, Texture and TinyImagenet images. They will be automatically extracted to the correct folders in [data/images_classic](./images_classic).

For the rest of the ID & OOD datasets in our benchmark, check the READMEs in their respective subfolders for download instructions.
